# Activities for Teaching Requirements Engineering

Starting in 2020, the [REET workshop series](https://reet-workshop.github.io/) invites submissions of activities for teaching requirements engineering (RE). Each RE teaching activity will

* focus on one or more RE skills
* define target audience and learning goals
* provide step-by-step guidelines for conducting the activity, including student hand-outs or associated slides
* describe the context of the activity
* briefly comment on its prior use in the classroom

RE teaching activities appearing here have been lightly reviewed by REET workshop program committee members and accepted for presentation at the REET workshop. 

This repository is inspired by the [Nifty Assignments](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) sessions at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium series. It responds to the community's need for high-quality, ready-to-use activities that educators or trainers can use to provide hands-on experience with RE concepts and skills.
