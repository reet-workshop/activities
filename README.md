# Activities for Teaching Requirements Engineering

This repository provides free (libre and gratis) access to activities for teaching requirements engineering (RE). These activities have been (lightly) peer-reviewed and accepted for presentation at one of the following venues.
* [REET workshop series](https://reet-workshop.github.io/) (Requirements Engineering Education and Training) from 2020 to present
* [OpenRE track](https://2021.refsq.org/track/refsq-2021-openre) at [REFSQ 2021](https://2021.refsq.org/) (Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality)

Each of these activities will
* focus on one or more RE skills
* define target audience and learning goals
* provide step-by-step guidelines for conducting the activity, including student hand-outs or associated slides
* describe the context of the activity
* briefly comment on its prior use in the classroom

This repository is inspired by the [Nifty Assignments](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) sessions at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium series. It responds to the community's need for high-quality, ready-to-use activities that educators or trainers can use to provide hands-on experience with RE concepts and skills.
